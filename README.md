Dance for Me is an interactive AR experience in which players mimic a variety of dances performed by 3D model animations with real time feedback. The motivation behind this project lies in encouraging desk-bound computer scientists to get up and dance. Dance for Me was built to interact with users and embodies serendipitous exertion to encourage participants to engage. This gives our avatar ‘Delboi’ a human like feel which is an objective that we strived to achieve. 


With aims to ...
* Create an engaging and immersive dancing system for users in computer science building e.g. waving and dancing to users to join dancing together by the mascot, give feedback when playing by voice lines or subtitles  
* Create a system for tracking and scoring players’ dance moves  
* Create an aesthetic system e.g. designing the avatar and the colour theme
